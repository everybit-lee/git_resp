研究目标：信息技术已经成为社会发展的重要引擎。信息技术在教育领域有着深入而广泛的应用。该怎样去评估信息技术在教育领域的应用程度？信息技术在教育领域中有哪些研究路径和趋势？
材料和方法：对研究领域中知名的12个期刊在web of science核心库中被收录的8131篇文献进行关键词

The use of IT in education represents a promising tool to facilitate the communication as a whole in educational progress. Most of the studies focus on the specific impact of IT in the educational process, e.g., gamification makes the educational process more intuitive and interesting, e-learning remove communication barriers among participants, social network breaks the time barrier, etc..
Nevertheless, little research has focused on providing a comprehensive literature review, which will help researchers to better understand how this stream of research

信息技术在教育中的应用，是促进教育整体传播的一种很有前途的工具。大多数的研究集中在教育过程中，例如它的具体影响，游戏化，使教育过程更直观和有趣，学习消除沟通障碍的参与者，社会网络打破了时空的阻隔，等。


Nevertheless, little research has focused on providing a comprehensive literature review, which will help researchers to better understand how this stream of research has evolved over latest decade.
In this study, we use TF/IDF and co-occurrence analysis in order to provide useful up-to-date information to picture the state of the art about current research and evolution of the topic. Analysis on Data sets obtained from titles and abstracts extracted from 8131 articles published in 12 journals over the last decade (2007–2017) allowed identifying relevant
authors and institutions, key constructs and themes involved, and trends of knowledge development. Main findings suggest an increasing academic interest on the topic over the last 5 years and a wide variety of constructs that were clustered in four main themes that we named: (i) effectiveness, (ii) acceptance, (iii) engagement and (iv) social interactions. Future research lines are also addressed.
